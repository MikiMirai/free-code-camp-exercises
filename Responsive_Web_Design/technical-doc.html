        <p>Crypton had the idea to release Miku as "an android diva in the near-future world where songs are lost."</p>
        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        <p>The name was chosen by combining hatsu <code>(初, "first")</code>, ne <code>(音, "sound")</code>, and Miku <code>(未来, a personal name that shares its spelling with the word for "future")</code>. It thus means "the first sound from the future." Her name was based on her concept of that when a sound is first spoken.[9]

Her codename of <code>"CV01"</code> means <code>"Character Voice 01"</code>.

Her name in Chinese is <code>"Chūyīn Wèilái" (Simplified Chinese: 初音未来; Traditional Chinese: 初音未來)</code>.</p>

        <p>After an internet meme involving Hachune Miku, Miku was associated with a spring onion (often mistaken for a leek due to the similar appearance). This, along with KAITO's association with ice cream, started a discussion called "the Item War" within the VOCALOID fandom, where it became traditional for new VOCALOIDs to have an item assigned to them and the items were debated upon until one stuck via an Internet Meme. This occurrence has since died out.</p>

        <h3>Marketing</h3>
        <p>Miku's initial marketing was similar to past software synthesizers and VOCALOID voicebanks, and was standard marketing for the software at her time of release. For the most part a large proportion was centered on DTM MAGAZINE, like MEIKO and KAITO before her since the readership of the magazine had greatly influenced those two past VOCALOIDs. The only pre-planned promotion was with DTM MAGAZINES November 2007 issue - due to the inclusion of a CD with the demo of Miku on it, this particular issue sold out. When Hatsune Miku was on pre-order it was noted MEIKO and KAITO had no prospect of receiving updates and that Miku would be taking over their roles going forward.
<br>
<br>
          Since the success of her voicebank led to an expansion of marketing possibilities, most of the mass marketing has come after her initial release as a response to her popularity. Even with the addition of other Character Vocals, Miku's name continues to be used as the primary source of marketing for Crypton Future Media. In March 2012, the Nomura Research Institute estimated that the sales of all "Hatsune Miku" brand goods added up into the region of ¥10,000,000,000 since her release in 2007.[17] Miku's name is now the easiest of all VOCALOIDs to market. Also owed to her popularity, many VOCALOID related products such as piano sheet music packs, books, and magazines carry her image on the front cover. Around January 28, 2013, a 3 day survey was run by Tokyo Polytechnic University. During the survey (based on ages 12–38) 95% of those entering reported knowing who Hatsune Miku was, in comparison participants barely knew who Megpoid, IA, or Aoki Lapis were.

        <h3>Sales</h3>
        <p>The initial sales of Hatsune Miku were so high that Crypton could not keep up with the demand. In the first 12 days of sale, nearly 3,000 sales reservations were made. This was around one sale in 250 in the music software industry, quoted as "an impossible number" by Wataru Sasaki — the person in charge of the planning and production. Amazon.co.jp stated on September 12, 2007 that they had sales of Hatsune Miku totaling <code>57,500,001 yen</code>, making her the number one selling software at that time.[44] It was confirmed in her first year alone, Miku sold 40,000+ units, on an average of 300 units per week.[45] Later reports came that she had sold 60,000+ copies of her software. To add perspective, normally selling 1,000 copies of a synthesizing software was considered good business.</p>
        <h3>Reaction</h3>
        <p>Before Miku was released, VOCALOID™ was not much more than an obscure program. Nico Nico Douga played a fundamental role in the recognition and popularity of the software today. Soon after its release, users of Nico Nico Douga started posting videos with songs created using the software. According to Crypton, a popular video with a comically-altered Miku holding a spring/Welsh onion, singing Ievan Polkka, presented multifarious possibilities of using the software in multimedia content creation. Miku gained her first <code>1,000,000+</code> song on 15th October 2007 with the song みくみくにしてあげる♪ (Miku Miku ni Shite Ageru♪), in addition it also became the first VOCALOID song to reach 1,000,000 views. It achieved <code>1,000,000+</code> views in less than 26 days.</p>
        <h3>Trivia</h3>
        <p>Because she is the first VOCALOID vocal many got to know and the first to draw a large amount of attention, there are a number of common misconceptions about her:
          <br>
          <br>
Miku is often mistaken as the very first vocal released for VOCALOID by those new or unfamiliar with the software's history, or the first VOCALOID2 released.
While she was the first VOCALOID2 to be released for the Japanese market, it was PowerFX's Sweet ANN who claimed the place as the first VOCALOID2, released 2 months prior to Miku.
<br>
<br>
When Miku became more well-known in 2010, the media also followed this misconception. On more than one occasion Crypton Future Media have labelled her as the first, though this is likely an error as they usually introduce her as "the first of the character vocal series".
However, Miku was the first VOCALOID vocal developed specifically for VOCALOID2 as Sweet ANN, codenamed "JODIE" was originally developed for the VOCALOID engine, not VOCALOID2.
<br>
<br>
Since 2010, Miku has won the classification of "Virtual Diva" and has become a pop star in her own right. However, some reports mislabel her as "the first virtual star" when other "virtual stars" have been released prior to her existence as early as the mid-1990s, although these "stars" never rose to the level of popularity Miku has reached.[80] An example of a group of virtual singers from 2002 would be the VBirds.
<br>
<br>
Miku is also not the first VOCALOID vocal to debut in America, as Zero-G's VOCALOIDs were already on sale prior to her arrival. However, all previous VOCALOID vocals failed to make an impact in the US.</p>
