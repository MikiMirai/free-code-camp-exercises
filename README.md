## How to run
1. Download the pair of .html and .css files with the same name
2. Open the .html files in your browser of choice

## Possible issues
- If something looks wrong on the page check if the `<link href="./example-stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet" />` inside the .html file, has the correct file name in the **href**
